      <title>ÜBERFEST RED vs. BLU Bonk vs. Jarate Propaganda Contest</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<a href="https://discord.gg/kritzkast" target="_blank"><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/news/254398/prop_prop_small.png?t=1496190998"></a>

<p>Troops! Once again you find yourselves approaching the ultimate assault. Not of teams drawn from across the wide divides of Europe to see which group of 6 can hold aloft the ÜBERFEST trophy. But the true fight, the Epic battle of beverages named in honour of RED and BLU Bonk! In this great age, truth be damned, it's propaganda that sets the hearts of fighting drinking combatants ablaze.</p><br>

<p>KritzKast now gives YOU a chance to make those images, to design posters exulting the Glory of RED Bonk, the Vigour of BLU Bonk, or the rank rancid moreishness of Jarate!</p><br>

<p>Submit your poster entries to the <a href="https://discord.gg/kritzkast" target="_blank">KritzKast Discord</a> before October 29th. Winners will have their creations made real, turned into posters, displayed at ÜBERFEST LAN above battle stations and bar stools, signed by production staff, players, and any still sober enough to hold a pen, then returned to you. And of course there will be KritzKast <a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Lo-Fi_Longwave" target="_blank">hats</a> aplenty, too.</p><br>

<p>Good luck, have fun and we’ll see you all at ÜBERFEST.</p><br>
