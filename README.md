gbans is a centralized game administration system for Team Fortress 2 that incorporates a global ban system similar to
[sourcebans++](https://github.com/sbpp/sourcebans-pp/) as well as some additional basic community tools like news, forums & wikis.
The project was initially only intended to be a more modern & secure replacement for sourcebans, but has evolved to
handle broader community aspects.

## Stability / Usage Notice

While we currently are [dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) the project on a
community with around 50 servers, I would not recommend non-developers use the project yet. It's still in fairly
major development mode and large sections are still incomplete or function but very rough.

Before we tag a 1.0.0 release, we will write some proper user-facing documentation. You can however look at the 
currently incomplete [docs](https://leighmacdonald.github.io/gbans/docs/INTRO).

## Docker

Docker is recommended to run gbans. You can find the official docker images on
[ghcr.io](https://github.com/leighmacdonald/gbans/pkgs/container/gbans).

Assuming you have created your config file and have a database setup you can run it using something
like:

    docker run -it --rm -v `$(pwd)`/gbans.yml:/app/gbans.yml:ro ghcr.io/leighmacdonald/gbans:latest

There is also a docker-compose config you can use which provides the database as well.

    docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up --build --remove-orphans --abort-on-container-exit --exit-code-from gbans
