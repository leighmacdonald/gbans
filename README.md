gbans was initially intended to be a more modern & secure replacement 
for [sourcebans](https://github.com/GameConnect/sourcebansv1) / [sourcebans++](https://sbpp.dev). It has since
had its scope expanded to include more optional support for general game server management tasks as well
as future plans for in depth plater stat tracking.


## Stability / Usage Notice

While we currently are [dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) the project on a 
community with around 50 servers, I would not recommend non-developers use the project yet. It's still in fairly 
major development mode and large sections are still incomplete or function but very rough. This is 
very notable for the web frontend which we don't really use yet. Sticking with the discord command interface is the 
best current way to interact with the system.

Before we tag a 1.0.0 release, we will write some proper user-facing documentation.

## Primary differences from sourcebans++

- No direct SQL queries across networks. Exposing MySQL to the internet is a very poor security practice. You can 
of course mitigate this with firewalls and sql accounts with ip restrictions or VPNs, but the majority of 
server admins will not ever do this.
- Game servers authenticate with the gbans server upon startup of the plugin. Subsequent requests will use the returned
authentication token.
- Communication over HTTPS
- Discord bot integration for administration & announcements.
- Built using [Go 1.18beta1+](https://golang.org/) & [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). It has a built-in
  webserver that is safe to directly expose to the internet. This means it's not necessary to setup MySQL, Nginx/Apache
  and PHP on your server.
- Non-legacy codebase that is (hopefully) not a nightmare to hack on.

## Docker

Docker is recommended to run gbans. You can find the official docker images at 
[dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/leighmacdonald/gbans).

Assuming you have created your config file and have a database setup you can run it using something
like:

    docker run -it --rm -v `$(pwd)`/gbans.yml:/app/gbans.yml:ro leighmacdonald/gbans:latest

There is also a docker-compose config you can use which provides the database as well.

    docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up --build --remove-orphans --abort-on-container-exit --exit-code-from gbans
